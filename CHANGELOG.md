## [1.0.0] First Major release
### Summary of changes
This release represents the biggest change for the API to date.  Essentially, all interaction
can now be done through the `ALPlayer` class.  See the README.md for usage.

### Added
- `ALPlayer` class now pulls all the data including events if the player is being tracked.
- New convenience method `print_description` for dumping a player class to a readable format
- `ALPlayer` is structured to match the json response from the API

### Changed
- Player history is automatically added to the player class when created by the API
- Arrow library is now required for timestamp parsing

### Fixed
- Response for non-tracked player no longer throws an uncaught exception

## [0.3.0]
### Changed
- Re-arranged module files and imports
  - `al_base` is where utility / base classes will go that are shared across modules
  - `al_api` is the core API interface class
  - `al_domain` is the module that will contain all the 'domain' based
    classes such as `ALPlayer` (eventually 'matches', etc...)
- Class renames (which will change the API).  Now all classes are prefixed with `AL` (Apex Legends)
- Updated README.md to reflect the changes

### Added
- Added 'Player' class
- Added new method to the API to delete all tracked players

## [0.2.1]

  simpler
